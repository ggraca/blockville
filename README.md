# Blockville, a farmchain game

Blockville is a world-building game entirely based on the blockchain tecnology.
The players can occupy tiles of terrain, build structures on them and collect income.
It draws inspiration from other recent games, such as CryptoKitties (a game mainly built on top of blockchain), Minecraft and Civilization.
